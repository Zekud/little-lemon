# Little Lemon Booking Website

Welcome to the Little Lemon Booking Website project! This repository contains a simple booking website built using React, React Router, and designed using Figma. The project's primary functionalities include routing and a booking form with validation. Additionally, there's an API integrated for testing and simulation purposes, but it doesn't have real functionality. <b> Please note that some functionalities are under development.</b>.

Even if it is under development, you can check the project [Here](http://zekua.me/little-lemon/).
